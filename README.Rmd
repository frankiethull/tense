`tense` is an R package that uses a large language model to forecast any univariate ordered numeric sequence (time series, spatial profiles, simulation traces, etc.). It works by mapping numeric values to a fixed sentiment lexicon (e.g., "excellent", "solid", "poor", "dire"), feeding the resulting word sequence to an LLM with a sliding context window, and asking the model to continue the pattern. The output is a numeric forecast by decoding sequences of sentiment words that describes the predicted trajectory. The package provides `tense_init()`, `tense_fit()`, `tense_predict()`. 


note that LLMs are stochastic in nature. predicting univariate ordered sequences using large language models via sentiment-encoded prompts will return different results every time. The results will also be different depending on the LLM used, temperature setpoint, & context window length.

## a tense example

comparison of different models, temperatures, and context windows. **Note that results will change every time the code is executed, even with seeds set LLM results can vary.**

```{r}
library(tense)
library(ggplot2)

t <- seq(0, 60, by = 0.5)
y <- sin(t) * 10
train <- y[1:(length(y) - 30)]
test <- y[(length(y) - 29):length(y)]

h <- length(test)
```


```{r}
